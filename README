Gene's simple SMTP server.  A (hopefully) simple program to receive
Internet (RFC 5321) mail.

Free software — AGPLv3+

Written using Standard C++ — plus OpenSSL, boost, ldns, spf2, regdom
and cdb.  Compiles with GCC 4.9.0 and clang 3.4.  Needs Bison >3.0.

No runtime configuration file — code as configuration.

Plain old (GNU) Makefile — no generated make files or fancy tools.

Run it from (x)inetd or daemontools as a non-root user.  It will
accept mail and store it in that user's ~/Maildir.

I run it on GNU/Linux — might also work on other platforms.
