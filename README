Gene Hightower's simple SMTP server.

A program to receive Internet (RFC 5321) mail.

Free software — AGPLv3

Written using Standard C++ — plus Ragel, OpenSSL, boost, ldns, spf2,
regdom, TinyCDB, glog etc.  Compiles with recent GCC and Clang.

No runtime configuration file — code as configuration.

Run it from (x)inetd or daemontools as a non-root user.  It will
accept mail and store it in that user's ~/Maildir.

I run it on GNU/Linux — might also work on other platforms.
