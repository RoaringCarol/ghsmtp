Gene Hightower's SMTP server.

A program to receive Internet (RFC 5321) mail.

Free software — AGPLv3 with OpenSSL exception.

Written using Standard C++ — plus PEGTL, (at one time Ragel), OpenSSL,
boost, ldns, spf2, regdom, TinyCDB, glog etc.  Compiles with recent
GCC and Clang.

Run it from (x)inetd or daemontools as a non-root user.  It will
accept mail and store it in that user's ~/Maildir.

I run it on the Fedora distribution of GNU/Linux/systemd — might also
work on other platforms.
