Just dropping you a note using SMTPUTF8, since you asked.

As far as I know, Google is /still/ the only major domestic email
service that supports SMTPUTF8.  There are a few in China (中国) that
seem to also.

Can you imagine?  We have been forcing the whole world to use US-ASCII
to the left of the '@' for like 35 years!

And what about BINARYMIME?  Is that /ever/ going to happen?

BTW: I am /not/ using Google.
