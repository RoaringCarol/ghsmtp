Today the pyramid at first looks like a natural hill surmounted by a
church. This is the Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios
(Church of Our Lady of Remedies), also known as the Santuario de la
Virgen de los Remedios (Sanctuary of the Virgin of Remedies), which
was built by the Spanish in colonial times (1594) on top of the
prehispanic temple. The church is a major Catholic pilgrimage
destination, and the site is also used for the celebration of
indigenous rites. Many ancient sites in Latin America are found under
modern Catholic holy sites, due to the practice of the Catholic Church
of repurposing local religious sites.
